## Design Direction
The interface should feel like a trusted companion - calm, reliable, and immediately understandable in high-stress situations, with clear visual hierarchy that works across diverse lighting conditions and cultural contexts.

## Color Selection
Complementary (opposite colors) - High contrast is essential for accessibility and emergency visibility.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.4 0.15 240)) - Communicates trust, reliability, and medical safety
- **Secondary Colors**: Soft Gray (oklch(0.85 0.02 240)) for backgrounds, maintaining readability
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant Orange (oklch(0.75 0.15 45)) - Immediate attention for alerts and emergencies  
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Blue text (oklch(0.2 0.1 240)) - Ratio 8.1:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.4 0.15 240)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 7.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Vibrant Orange oklch(0.75 0.15 45)): Dark Blue text (oklch(0.2 0.1 240)) - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography must be instantly readable in emergency situations with clear distinction between alert levels - using Inter for its exceptional legibility and Atkinson Hyperlegible for enhanced accessibility.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Emergency Alerts): Atkinson Hyperlegible Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Feature Headers): Inter Bold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Status Updates): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Instructions): Atkinson Hyperlegible Regular/16px/relaxed line height
